Quantum physics stands at the beginning of the 20th century - with great minds from Planck to Hilbert 
navigating the complex world of quantum physics.
<br/>
We begin with a conceptual understanding of the field--moving down from our classical world (or should 
we say moving *smaller*?). <br/>

# I. The Birth of Quantum Theory
Quantum theory goes hand-in-hand with the emergence of the **Bohr model** in atomic theory, and the 
initiation of **statistical mechanics** by Boltzmann, both conceptually and chronologically. To avoid 
meandering, we'll provide only the necessary bits from both of these conceptual bodies, but it's very useful 
to have a good understanding of both when going into quantum theory!

## **1. Blackbodies and Energy Quantization**
A **blackbody** is an ideal object that absorbs all electromagnetic waves, regardless of the wave frequency 
and angle of incidence. Blackbody **radiation** is the radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal equilibrium 
with its environment. 
<br/>
A classic example of a blackbody is a cavity, such as a box, with thermally insulated walls with a small hole:
<img src='/assets/images/blog/quantum-intro/blackbody.png' class='mx-auto max-w-52 max-h-52'/>
If an electromagnetic ray "hits" the hole, it will enter the insulated blackbody and will be reflected inside, 
with energy transferring between the cavity and the light, before it exits the cavity by chance. This energy 
transfer enables the light to reach **thermal equilibrium** with the cavity itself--making the light that exits the 
blackbody "different" from the initial ray.

### 1.1 &nbsp; The Physics of the Blackbody
To understand the significance of the blackbody to quantum theory, we will first investigate the physics of
this blackbody with statistical mechanics--particularly, the *energy* of the wave.
<br/>
First, consider a *cubic* cavity with side lengths $l$, and a small hole to allow a trapped electromagnetic wave
to escape. Given that an electromagnetic wave has been trapped in this blackbody, we establish:
> 1. **The electric field $E$ at the walls must be $0$.** <br/>
> The walls of our blackbody are *conductive*, so $E=0$ at these boundaries.
> 2. **The trapped wave can be represented as a superposition of sinusoidal waves.** <br/>
> With (1) established, we know that the Fourier expansion of this wave is complete.
> 3. **The modes of standing waves are dimensionally-independent.**<br/>
> An extension of (2), this simply states that the standing wave modes that we use to represent our trapped wave
> in each direction are independent of each other--for example, any mode in the $x$ direction can exist with any
> mode in the $y$ or $z$ direction.

<BlogCollapsible title='A mental image'>
This paints a bit of an abstract picture. To illustrate a mental image, it's useful to imagine a box with a *ton* 
of different waves inside--since we're constructing a canonical ensemble, we imagine *all possible waves* that could 
exist inside this box. Your imagined box should look a bit like a box filled with spaghetti waves, traveling from
every possible point on the box to its opposite side. Now, let's modify our image, based on the above stipulations:
- **At the walls, $E = 0$. (Point 1)**<br/>
The spaghetti waves at the walls will always be at the equilibrium point of the wave. This will make the electric
field at the walls 0.
- **We can represent the wave as a superposition of dimensionally-independent sine waves. (Points 2 and 3)**<br/>
First, we split each spaghetti wave into a bunch of spaghetti sines. This is our *Fourier expansion* of the spaghetti
wave into standing waves, so the sine waves we split each spaghetti wave into will start and end at the same place. They will have different amplitudes and wavelengths to compose the original wave. <br/><br/>
Now, each spaghetti sine is decomposed into 3 separate spaghetti waves, each representing their respective $x$, $y$, 
and $z$ components of the original spaghetti strand. Our box is now filled with a ton of spaghetti sine waves all pointing in
the same $x$, $y$, or $z$ directions.

Opting to represent all *possible* modes of this wave mathematically, 
$$
l = n \frac {\lambda}{2}
$$
where n is an integer. Since we have 3 degrees of freedom with the same side length $l$, we have 3 separate
$n$ for each degree of freedom: $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$. <br/><br/>
**How many different configurations of n can we have?** Well, we know $n$ can be any positive integer, and we have
3 different $n$ for each degree of freedom. The total amount of different configurations of $n$ we can have 
would be:
$$
\text{all }n_x \times \text{all }n_y \times \text{all }n_z
$$
This isn't very useful of an expression, so we instead consider the volume of a coordinate system--the above
expression is the same as the volume of the positive octant of a cartesian coordinate system! So to represent
*all possible wave modes*:
$$
2 \times \int_{(+, +, +)}d^3n
$$
We integrate in the positive octant of a coordinate system $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$. The factor of 2 that we multiply
this integral by comes from the fact that all light has **two polarization modes** which doubles the
possible configurations of $n$.<br/><br/>
However, we want to represent the total modes in terms of a more typical quantity--angular frequency. To do this, 
we take a few steps:
$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{n\pi}{l}, \quad \omega = \frac{n\pi c}{l}
$$
Where $k$ represents the wavenumber, and $\omega$ represents the angular frequency of this wave. Then, converting
the above expression:
$$
d^3n = \left( \frac{l^3}{\pi^3c^3} \right)d^3\omega
$$
$$
\frac{2l^3}{\pi^3c^3}\int_{(+,+,+)}d^3\omega = \frac{2l^3}{\pi^3c^3}\times\frac{1}{8}\int 4\pi\omega^2d\omega = \frac{V}{\pi^2c^3}\int\omega^2d\omega 
$$
Where volume $V = l^3$. With this representation, we use the **equipartition theorem** to state the energy of this wave:
$$
E=\frac{V}{\pi^2c^3}k_BT\int\omega^2d\omega
$$

### 1.2 &nbsp; Planck and The Ultraviolet Catastrophe
Physicists in the early 20th century came to the same conclusion as above to represent the energy of a blackbody.
To follow, the formulated **Rayleigh-Jeans Law** takes the above expression with intensity formula $E = \int I(\omega)d\omega$ to state:
$$
I(\omega) = \omega^2\frac{Vk_BT}{\pi^2c^3}
$$
which makes $I\propto\omega^2$, as all other variables are constants. This means, at high angular frequencies, 
our intensity increases rapidly without bound--which is known as the **Ultraviolet Catastrophe**. 

We know this relation is untrue, due to the fact that the energy *inside* the blackbody is finite, while the expression says that at infinitely high frequencies, the blackbody will emit an *infinite* amount of radiation and energy. <br/><br/>

Planck noted this too; the square-relation of spectral intensity to angular frequency meant that our current model resulting
in the UV catastrophe was incorrect. He instead developed a model using the assumption that radiation emitted a whole number multiple of finite packets of energy, dubbed *quanta*.

In the case of our blackbody and light, this packet of energy was discovered 5 years later by Einstein and named--the **photon**. The energy of these packets is dictated by
$$
E = hf = \hbar\omega
$$
With this, we modify our relation to create a *new* partition function to find an expression for intensity.

> \ln{Z}=\sum_{\text{all possible }\omega}\ln{\left( \frac{1}{1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}\right)}\cdot \frac{V}{\pi^2c^3}\int\omega^2 d\omega 
> $$
> $$
>=\frac{V}{\pi^2c^3} \int{\omega^2}\ln{\left( \frac{1}{1-e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}\right)}d\omega
> $$
> Finally performing the partial derivative,
> $$
> -\frac{\partial \ln{Z}}{\partial\beta}=\frac{V\hbar}{\pi^2c^3}\int\frac{\omega^3}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}d\omega
> $$
With this expression for energy, we arrive at **Planck's law**:
$$
I(\omega)=\frac{V\hbar}{\pi^2c^3}\frac{\omega^3}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}
$$
Notice we used the same energy-intensity relation from before. This equation can be manipulated very simply converting angular frequency $\omega$ to frequency $\nu$ and substituting constants: $\beta =\frac{1}{k_BT}$, $\omega=2\pi\nu$ and $\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}$ into a more recognizable form:
$$
B(\nu)=\frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_BT}}-1}
$$
Note that the volume $V$ drops out, as $B(\nu)$ is an expression of spectral intensity per unit.

What does this mean for our blackbody? Well, the intensity of the radiation emitted by the blackbody is now finite at all frequencies, and the UV catastrophe is avoided. This is the first step into the world of quantum physics--the quantization of energy.

We have established that **energy is discrete**, coming in integer multiples of packets, kind of like individual balls of energy.
## **2. &nbsp; The Wave-Particle Duality**
Having established that energy is quantized, we move forward to the next fundamental concept of quantum mechanics--the **wave-particle duality**.

It's important to understand what we mean by wave-like and particle-like behavior in the context of physics:
- **Particle-like** behavior describes behavior that obeys classical mechanics, the motion of everyday objects such as a box or a ball as we understand it.
These classical particles have definite positions and momenta, and obey classical concepts such as Newton's laws. Most importantly, particles *do not exhibit interference* - they do not occupy the same space as each other and interfere. 
- **Wave-like** behavior describes behavior modeled by the wave equation. Classical waves display *interference* when multiple waves occupy the same space, and exhibit other behaviors such as
diffraction.

These behaviors are both *models* for the behaviors of physical things, and in the classical world, they are largely mutually exclusive--that is, something like sound is modeled by a wave, while a baseball is
modeled by a particle.

However, the lines begin to blur in the quantum scope. This was first observed in the behavior of light, but as we'll come to see, 
this blurring applies to **all matter**. 

### 2.1 &nbsp; The Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect is explained by considering light as a particle.

### 2.2 &nbsp; The Double-Slit Experiment

### 2.3 &nbsp; The Matter Wave

# II. Fundamental Quantum Concepts
Having established our theoretical precendent for quantum mechanics, we now move to explaining the concepts of
quantum mechanics. 

The language of quantum mechanics can be simplified to two basic fundamental concepts: wave functions, and observables.
- A **wave function** describes the state of a system--all of its properties at a given time. Essentially, when discussing
the state of something, we are discussing everything we know about it at a given time. For example, the state of a moving 
particle would include its position and momentum.
- An **observable** is a property of a system that can be *measured*.

Having established this, we continue to a more detailed discussion of these concepts!

## **1. &nbsp; The Wavefunction**
The wavefunction is a mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a given system. Much like how a physicist might use or determine a function for an object's position, $x(t)$, in a classical scenario, a wavefunction $\psi(x,t)$
represents the state of a system--for example, a particle.
$$
\underset{\text{classical}}{x(t)} \rightarrow \underset{\text{quantum}}{\psi(x,t)}
$$

This function is complex-valued and satisfy the definition of a vector in the infinite-dimensional **Hilbert space**. As such, we use linear algebra
and vector properties to manipulate wavefunctions to yield information about the system.
