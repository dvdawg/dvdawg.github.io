this is a line of `code`

this is a block of code with syntax highlighting:
```c
printf("freakybob\n");
char freak[100];
printf("your response? ");
scanf("%s", freak);
```

and this is without:
```
printf("freakybob\n");
char freak[100];
printf("your response? ");
scanf("%s", freak);
```

* this is a list
* this is a list second element
  * indented element
  1. ordered
  2. list
  3. yay!

there should be a 

sufficient space between these two.
