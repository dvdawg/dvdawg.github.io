What is physics? 

There's a variety of common definitions:
- "The scientific study of matter and energy and the relationships between them, including the study of forces, heat, light, sound, electricity and the structure of atoms" (Oxford Dictionary)
- "Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force" (Wikipedia)
- "The scientific study of matter and energy and the effect that they have on each other" (Cambridge Dictionary)

These definitions are "dictionary definitions"; besides actually being in dictionaries, they explain by enumerating all the various parts of physics, which isn't necessarily a good way to understand the subject itself. Our purpose here is not to understand these constituent parts, but to rather get an intuition on what physics attempts to do. 

Every given definition---not limited to these dictionary definitions, but *every* definition---is a bit different, because physics is a constantly evolving field. In the words of Feynman, there is an "expanding frontier of ignorance" in the sciences - every step forward is just another view into what we do not know. Even within the sciences, it's difficult to divide and define the pursuit of knowledge in discrete divisions; it seems as though every day there is a new variety of scientist created with an ever-blurring spectrum in each discipline.

So---let's start with a (hopefully) easier question: what is science?
