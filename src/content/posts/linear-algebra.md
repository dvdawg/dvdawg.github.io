William Stein famously stated "*Mathematics is the art of reducing any problem to linear algebra*" -- and for good reason -- linear algebra stands as one of the most useful tools in a mathematician's arsenal. <br><br>

To provide a brief introduction, linear algebra concerns the behaviors of linear maps, and linear relations (hence the "linear").
$$
\overbrace{a_1x_1+...+a_nx_n = c}^{\text{linear relations}}\quad \text{and} \quad \overbrace{V \rightarrow W}^{\text{linear maps}}
