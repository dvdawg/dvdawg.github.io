My life is like a Kubernetes game

Trying hard to scale the pods

All while I am still deploying nodes

Trying hard to balance loads

Microservices, I'm handling traffic

I'm growing clusters to be robust

I battle with the failing states

I troubleshoot and integrate

Sorry, but your deployment isn't here

I take a rest, I push the pods

Scale up and move along

In hopes that the next build, I will clear

I finally passed, cluster

I'm just trying to keep from crashing

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes

Looking for a better way to play it

Life is for logging events and forevermore

Stop complaining and start changing it

Today I went to the terminal

Told it my embarrassing

Issues that I'm having with my nodes (with my nodes)

It told me that I need to change

Life is not a Kubernetes game

So stop playing and open up your eyes

I'm just trying to keep from crashing

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes

Looking for a better way to play it

Life is for logging events and forevermore

Stop complaining and start changing it

Don't talk about it, just be about it

Don't ever doubt it, even when your clusters are clouded

I may be crazy, but life's amazing

And through it all and even with your pods failing

So just know that it's okay

My life is like a Kubernetes game

Trying hard to scale the pods

All while I am still deploying nodes

kubectl apply, kubectl get, kubectl describe, kubectl start

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes

Looking for a better way to play it

Life is for logging events and forevermore

Stop complaining and start changing it

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes

Looking for a better way to play it

Life is for logging events and forevermore

Stop complaining and start changing
